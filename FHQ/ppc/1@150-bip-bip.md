## Writeup

The archive is openable only by bruteforce. You can use different tools to crack it, and the speed depends on your CPU. For example, I used `Advanced Archive Password Recovery` and it found out that the password was `srhpm` in 3 seconds. With this password we took out this picture.

![ha](/FHQ/images/ppc/ha.png)

It has message `Z1nD0y0uw4N7fl49` on it and that is the flag.

Flag: `Z1nD0y0uw4N7fl49`
