## Writeup

This image gives us a hint what does this string `ACL(T0P_G1FZ_OC1$)` mean. To be precise, it gives us a hint that it is something that was encoded with Caesar cipher (because the image is a Caesar salad). I will use this [online service](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), it is super cool and I suggest you to use it also. You can do almost everything there and it is super simple and convinient. So you choose ROT13 there and change the coefficient and you will see that with the coefficient 5 it will give you `FHQ(Y0U_L1KE_TH1$)`.


Flag: `FHQ(Y0U_L1KE_TH1$)`
