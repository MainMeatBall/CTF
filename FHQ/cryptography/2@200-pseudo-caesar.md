## Writeup

The name of the file is `encrypted-rot13.txt` which means that this is message encrypted with Caesar cipher ROT13 and I have no idea why this task is called like this. Don't know. But here it is. After decoding this message, we get a text about Ford Mustang and somewhere near the end of the file we see `Flag:i_love_this_car`. That's the flag.

Flag: `i_love_this_car`
