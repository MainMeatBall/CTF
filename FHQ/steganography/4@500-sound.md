## Writeup

This task is difficult, unless you know what does this image represent. I didn't, so the solution came to me accidently. One day I was just playing another CTF and they had a very similar image, but there was a hint. It was somethinh about reading music from paper. So I just googled it and between many different sites I found the one. It is the app called [PhonoPaper](http://www.warmplace.ru/soft/phonopaper/index_ru.php). And you can watch this video so can understand how to solve this task.

After some time of trying to understand what does it say, maybe it will be possible, but maybe not. Actually, I think this task is too difficult and I could solve it only by accident.

Flag: `FHQ(Shelter_Snowflakes)`
